People blame themselves for their own difficulties. Humans do not always err.

_Why can you use computers and lab stuff and why can’t you use doors and shit?_

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

The human mind is tailored to make sense of the world. Give it the slightest clue and it provides explanation, rationalization, and understanding. Ex: Doors. Push, pull, slide in what direction. But on which part do you push?

Visibility: the correct parts must be visible, and they must convey the correct message.  Ex: Slide projector, short press to forward, long press to backward. Indicate how parts operate and how.

#### Affordances

* Plates = pushing
* Knobs = turning
* Slots = inserting shit
* Ball = throwing/bouncing
* Door (horizontal bar) = push, door (vertical bar) = pull
* Scissors = super familiar to use it, there are constraints. Big hole for big fingers, small hole for small fingers.
* Telephones: WTF is the sounds
* Car: Single controls have single functions. The system is understandable. The relationships and the results are sensibkle, nonarbitrary, and meaningful. There is good feedback, and the system is understandable.

#### Mapping

* Natural mapping: spatial analogy. To control lights, move the light switch up.
* Seat adjustment from Mercedes: The control is in the shape of the seat itself; the mapping is straightforward.
* Ex: Setting call dialing, why dial 60, why not 73 or 27? Redundant: Having to call the person again, and there is no right feedback that you have done the right thing.
* “Controls are where they ought to be. There is no difficulty.” Actually, the car has a lot of problems, but as far as usability, everything is where it is supposed to be.

#### Feedback

* Modern telephones have more features and less feedback.
* Ex: There is no way to put a diskette in the wrong way; there are various indentations and protrusions which prevent a user from inserting it in the wrong way.
* Subtle ribbing on a pen to make sure that you are holding it the correct way.

*The Paradox of Technology: The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device hrader to learn.*

## Chapter 2: The Psychopathology of Everyday Actions

* Ex: What is the difference between “return” and “enter”? Designer said, “didn’t you read the manual?”
* Ex: Thermostat: Two theories. Timer theory means that the thermostat controls the relative proportion of time that the device stays on. Valve theory: The thermostat controls how much heat comes out of the device.
* Correct story: The thermostat is just an on-off switch.
* If we don’t know if what the right answer is, we assign blame or credit immediately. If you fail at something, you think it is your fault, and you think that you can’t do that task.

#### Stages of Action

* Forming the goal
* Forming the intention
* Specifying an action
* Executing the action
* Perceiving the state of the world
* Interpreting the state of the world
* Evaluating the outcome

*Gulf of Execution: The difference between the intentions and the allowable actions.*

#### Seven Stages of Action as Design Aids

* Visibility: By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
* Good conceptual model: Consistent in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
* Good mappings. Possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.
* Feedback: The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions.

#### How easily can one…

* Tell what actions are possible?
* Determine mapping from intention to physical movement?
* Perform the action?
* Tell if the system is in the desired state?
* Determine mapping from system state interpretation?
* Tell what state the system is in?

## 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World

* Students cannot recall the pairings of letter-number in telephones, and typists can’t type when the keys are replaced.
* *This is because not all of the knowledge required for precise behavior has to be in the head. You don’t memorize everything because most of the information a person needs to do a task can reside in the world.*
* Constraints (both natural and cultural) reduce the number of alternatives and the specificity of knowledge required within human memory.
People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge: knowledge of and knowledge how.
* Of: knowledge of facts and rules.
* How: this enables a person to play music, etc. Procedural knowledge is difficult or impossible to write down and difficult to teach. It is taught by demonstration and best learned through practice.
* Ex: People arrange things differently, according to what they perceive is important for them. That’s why you are not supposed to fix another person’s room.
* Ex: French released a coin that is like a coin already in circulation, it was always mixed up with the old coin. The design was fantastic, but the coin was too similar to the hundreds of coins in circulation already.
* Ex: If I have one notebook, I call it “my notebook.” If I have two, I now have “my red notebook” or something.
* Ex: Rhyming is a constraint on all possible words to think about, so you are forced to be faster. So poets can just recreate stories over and over again, just editing words in the process.

#### Ways of Retrieving Information

* Memory for arbitrary things (rote shit).
* Memory for meaningful relationships
* Memory through explanation

#### Natural Mapping
* Ex: Stove, why do they insist to arrange the stoves rectangularly and the switches in a line?
Knowledge in the World vs Knowledge in the Head
* Data In the head is not as easily retrievable as data in the world.
* How easy it is to interpret information in the world depends upon how well it exploits natural mapping and constraints.

## 4: Knowing What to Do

Problems occur whenever there is more than one possibility of things to do. So use constraints to make sure that people can only do few courses of action at a time.

#### Types of Constraints

* Physical: Has to be super obvious. Ex: key slots, a well designed key will work regardless of what direction it was inserted.
* Semantic: The meaning of the situation. Ex: You sit the way you sit in a motorcycle because obviously the windshield has to be in front of you.
* Cultural: Red yellow green traffic lights.
* Logical: Left switch manipulates left light, right switch manipulates right light.
* Feedback: You can use sound instead of visibility to say that something has worked (click sound on a bolt, zzz on a zipper, rattle when things aren’t secured)

## 5: To Err is Human

* Slips: Automatic behavior that results in errors. These show up in skilled behavior.
* Mistakes: Consciously doing something wrong, you have a conclusion which doesn’t work.
* Ex: Car ignitions, there are different nozzles and receptacles to insert them in depending on what the fuel is.
* Human memory is not like a set of photographs; it mushes thigns together too much an confuses one event with another.
* Much of our knowledge is hidden beneath the surface of our minds, inaccessible to conscious inspection.
* Conscious thought: Slow and serial. It is limited to the amount that is readily available.
* Ex: You can’t lock yourself inside the car because you need the car keys to lock the car.
