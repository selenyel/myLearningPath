Why is the dashboard useful to your organization?

- Who is my audience?
- What value will the dashboard add?
- What type of dashboard am I creating?

- Role: Structure the information to make it super easy to answer high priority questions.
- Work flow: The form and information display needs to fit into an existing work flow. Ex: people on the road need information delivered to the Blackberry, not a wide-screen monitor.
- Data comfort/skills. Gauge whether the users will be proficient in data.
- Business and data expertise. They should know the key performance metrics and where the data comes from.

## Structure

- *Form.* This can be an email, a plasma TV.
- *Structure.* Doesn't need to be a grid.

"Dashboard content must be organized in a way that reflects the nature of the information and that supports efficient and meaningful monitoring. Information cannot be placed just anywhere on the dashboard, nor can sections of the display be sized simply to fit the available space. Items that relate to one another should usually be positioned close to one another. Important items should often appear larger, thus more visually prominent, than less important items. Items that ought to be scanned in a particular order ought to be arranged in a manner that supports that sequence of visual attention."

Structure Options: Either by flow (something like a sales pipeline or stages of customer support), relationships (which sales contribute to which), "grouping similar things together" (not preferred that much).

## Design Principles

- Compactness. Put things that can fit inside a human being's head.
- Gradual reveal. Key metrics, then context, then detail.
- Support casual use. Minimize clicks for reach task, and provide clear, concise descriptions of what things mean.
- Lead to action. *Empower the user to finish their task quickly and/or understand the action that should be taken based on the results. You can build in explicit guidance about what a change in a metric means, or who to contact to address an issue that is highlighted in the dashboard.*
- Customizable. You can define the scope of the data using filters. *Does the dashboard let the user save a view of the data they've configured? Does it offer easy ways to tag or highlight things that are important to them?*

*Explanation before information.* We need context and explanation to understand new and unfamiliar events. Better to have some base of factual information before you present data and stuff.

## Functionality

### Basics

- *Drill down.* Go from a summary metric or view to additional detail with more context.
- *Filters.* Allow users to define the scope of the data in the dashboard to reflect their needs.
- *Comparison.* Ability to see two or more subsets of the data side-by-side.
- *Alerts.* Highlight information based on pre-defined criteria.
- *Export/print.*

### Advanced

- *Text-based summary.* Automatically generated textual description of the key information in the dashboard.
- *Starring/tagging.* Ability for users to identify things in the dashboard that are important to them.
- *Annotation.* Allows users to add commentary to specific numbers or charts.
- *Save/track changes.*
- *Advanced visualization.*

## Information Design

### Tables

- Remove gridlines.
- Use lines or whitespace to separate areas that are conceptually different.
- Display the smallest amount of numbers that you can to support the needs of the table.
- Use consistent column and row spacing to create horizontal and vertical rhythm.
