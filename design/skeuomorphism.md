# Flat Pixels: The Battle Between Flat Design & Skeuomorphism
[link](http://sachagreif.com/flat-pixels/)

- Skeuomorphism: A physical ornament or design on an object copied from a form of the object when made from another material or by other techniques.
- Flat style: No textures/lighting effects, just simple shapes and flat colors.
- Before the iPhone, realism in UI was unusual, except for video games. *In order to preserve immersion, game designers crafted their UIs out of wood, metal, or stone.* In more serious contexts, realism was still very limited.
- With iOS, Apple decided to embrace realism even more: realism has some visual appeal, and since the iPhone was a new kind of device, realism helped link the future with the past, it made people feel at ease with the new device.
- Realism works because an app takes up the entirety of the screen. So no need for iPhone apps to adhere to their visual style.
- Since you use your finger (as opposed to a precise stylus), this means that the touch targets couldn't be smaller than a certain size. Bigger touch target requirements = easier to display actual graphics.
- Easier to actually design for the phone because the web has several possible modes and with the phone, you just have 1.

## The Problem with Skeuomorphism

- Realism done wrong can morph into kitsch (poor taste). Even in real life, fake leather and fake wood are not exactly good taste.
- You can make something look like a physical object but not work like it.
- You bring the physical limitations of the old element, even when these limitations have no reason to exist anymore. Calendars don't have to be limited to one month anymore.
