## 9 Usability Problems
[Link](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/18/9-common-usability-blunders/)
* Tiny Clickable Areas
* Pagination used for the wrong purposes: content is split for ad revenue, which sucks.
* Duplicate page titles, these are used by SEs for SEO purposes.
* Point of focus: Stronger, higher-contrast colors, larger fonts, images
* Each focal point should have a descriptive heading.
* Need to have a way to get in touch with the users, this is important if you want to build loyal customers. Enkoder, forms
* No way to search: There is a subset of people called search-dominant users. Sometimes you can just do something like a search for Google etc.
<form action="http://www.google.com/search" method="get"> <fieldset> <input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" value="smashingmagazine.com" /> <input type="text" name="q" size="31" maxlength="255" value="" /> <input type="submit" value="Google Search" /> </fieldset> </form>
* Too much functionality that needs registration. You have to be able to test drive the app.
* Old permalinks to nowhere: Permalinks should not be changeable.

## Techniques for UI in Web Apps

* Highlight important changes. When you get a change, SOMETHING must happen.
* Enable shortcuts if you can.
* Upgrade options from the account page.
* Advertise features of the application on the profile itself.
* Use color-coded list to figure out the latest messages, tasks, and files on the home page.
* Provide short help messages that get the user started.
* Design feedback messages carefully.
* Use tabbed navigation.
* Darken background under modal windows.
