- "We ended up not using the work."
- "It's really not what we wanted after all."
- "We got somebody internal to do it instead."
- "We cancelled the project."
- "We didn't get the funding we thought we would get."
- "We think we already paid the money we owe you."
- "It's really not what we're looking for." 

Fuck you, pay me!

Since we didn't have business experience we left money on the table re: contracts and stuff. If you're running a design biz, this is part of the job.

This is a biz. You have to pay people and you have to have clients.

All clients start a biz relationship with the best intentions, and things go wrong: market changes, your contact leaves, bad mood. Your relationship needs a contract.

You could write a heart-wrenching letter and screw things up, because the moment you write that letter and you appeal to the emotions you have given up on that relationship. You have shown them your belly and you have shown them that you don't have a leg to stand on other that playing upon guilt. You have become a bottom in that relationship. I would like designers to stop being bottoms and realize the amount of power in a relationship.

Clear definitions, clear expectations. Everybody should understand what they agreed to. You don't want to ignore something to make it clear.

## Bad Predicaments

*Company lays off entire division.* Had a contract not been in place, we would have spent a ton of time and money getting that job. 

The truth is you can write a mean letter, but if you want a lawsuit you want a contract.

*Client goes rogue.* It becomes a different project than the one you started with. That project is done. Open a new contract. When you're negotiating a sticky point you say that there is a scope of work. If you change it, you have to amend the scope of work.

*"You can trust us."* It's not a matter of trust. It's a matter of not knowing the client. I have to not trust them, and that's what you do when you have a business deal, you don't want to necessarily trust them, you want them to really pay you.

You cannot start a relationship like this because things will be really onerous. 

*Client brings in another designer.* That's a firable offense. We have been hired to solve a problem, if the client decides to bring somebody else, we're now in competition with this other designer.

*A good lawyer makes you money.* You get a lawyer when you decide to stop being a design amateur and decide to becoem a design professional. Decent lawyers will tell you what to expect to pay for stuff. Ask questions, if they don't answer how much stuff costs, then find another lawyer.

## 6 Things About Contracts

*Contracts protect both parties.*

*Don't start work without a contract.*

*Don't blindly accept their terms.*

*Anticipate negotiation, but don't back down on important stuff.*

Don't back down on:

- IP transfers on full payment. This is you leverage. The work you do is yours until they pay for it. If you deal with a big company you deal with the company owning the intellectual property from the moment you start signing the thing.
- Termination (Kill fee)
- Liability. Check for conditions such as "no bugs (XD)", "no stock photos", "no open-source software".

*Lawyers talk to lawyers.* If a company has a lawyer to protect them, then we have a lawyer to protect us.

*Be specific and confident about money.* If the first thing out of your mouth is "umm", you just lost 10 grand. If you know, say. If you don't, tell them you don't know but you'll get back to them. Just sound like you know what you're talking about even though you don't.

## 3 Point Winning Strategy
- Contracts Up Front
- Internal Allies (someone working with the client who knows how the client runs their business)
- Advisors

I want designers to have a lot more power than what they currently have.

The client can not make you do anything. Nobody can force you to do something.

The reason why you're firing the client needs to be in writing. They need to be aware that they've transgressed against X thing in the contract. They should know they're getting fired. Do it as kindly as possible. It is just a relationship that has gone sour.

You can preserve the relationship by telling the lawyers to deal with the issues. The first thing you do is to preserve the relationsip. Just resolve the stuff by talking in person. Plenty of client relationships are fixed by having a cup of coffee with somebody.

Acceptance: They have to have a certain amount of time to accept a deliverable, and if they don't bring up an issue, it is already accepted. Make the problems clear, and put it in writing.

I don't talk about clients on Twitter. Twitter is for dick jokes.
